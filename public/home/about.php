        As I was looking for a coding project to keep up my skills over the summer, I thought of creating a
        website to keep track of color wars scores. After realizing a fully-functional website would be quite
        a challenge, I  quickly got to work. Thankfully, I can say (with some bias) that I have succeeded in creating
        a website that can help facilitate all that is needed to manage color wars at CGC: viewing points, managing points,
        managing colors and groups, and storing user accounts for those who need it. Aside from being fun to make, my
        hope is that this website can make the management, accuracy, and viewing of color wars material for all who
        want to do so much easier.
