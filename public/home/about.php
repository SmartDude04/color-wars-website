        This website was created as a side-project for me to keep up my programming skills over the summer. Thankfully,
        my work here won't sit on a folder as so many projects do, and instead this website's purpose is to streamline
        the Color Wars process by making it much simpler to manage the week's fun-filled events. Hopefully you find some
        use in it!
