# **COLOR WARS**

This site is a fully-featured [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) website created to streamline
and modernize the week of *Color Wars* at a summer camp I work at. During this week, groups are put together into teams
where each team has a color. These teams then compete against each other in challenges throughout the day for points, and
at the end of the week, the team with the most points wins. It's always been a blast, but managing the points coming in
throughout camp was slow and manual, never mind displaying the points, which was done daily on boards on a field. So,
I decided to create a website that would solve both the adding and viewing of points for camp.
